# Model selection


```{r echo=FALSE}
load('01_model_selection.rda')
```
See `01_model_selection.R` for the detailed procedure and the outputs that
guided that procedure.

In a nutshell, models `m1`, `m2`, etc explore different combinations of
variables. These all take the form of a polynomial in $S$, $T$ and $p$, where
$T$ is in-situ temperature minus $T_0=`r T0`^\circ$C. (The reason for defining
$T$ this way is so the slide rule scale for temperature can start at $T_0$; an
offset like this is not needed for pressure because $0$dbar is a natural range
limit.

Taking first $S$, then $T$ and then $p$, model complexity was increased by
adding polynomial terms, and `summary()` was used to find the highest useful
term, by checking for a probability value (`Pr(>|t|)` in the output) that was
not scored with three asterisks, (i.e. that exceedd the standard R threshold of
2e-16).

# Choice of 'best' model

According to this scheme, the best model was `m4`, and that was saved in
`01_model_selection.rda` as `model`.

As noted in `01_model_selection.out`, model `m4` has
```
rms err. 0.4170 m/s (0.23% of range), worst 1.9201 m/s (1.07%) {ss ~ S + T + T2 + T3 + p + p2} 
```

# Summary of 'best' model

```{r}
summary(model)
```

# Coefficients of 'best' model

```{r}
coef(model)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
C <- coef(model)
```

# Slide-rule layout for 'best' model

*Salinity*: range from $S_0=`r S0`$ to $S_{max}=`r Smax`$, with distance ($x$)
function

\begin{equation}
x = `r C[1]` + `r C["S"]`S
\end{equation}

*Temperature*: range from $T_0=`r T0`^\circ$C to $T_{max}=`r Tmax`^\circ$C,
with distance function

\begin{equation}
x = `r C["T"]`(T-T_0) + `r C["T2"]`(T-T_0)^2 + `r C["T3"]`(T-T_0)^3
\end{equation}

*Pressure*: range from $p_0=`r p0`$dbar to $p_{max}=`r pmax`$dbar,
with distance function

\begin{equation}
x = `r C["p"]`p + `r C["p2"]`p^2
\end{equation}

The functions are illustrated below.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=10, dev.args=list(pointsize=12)}
par(mar=c(3,3,1,1), mgp=c(2,0.7,0), mfrow=c(3,1))
SS <- seq(S0, Smax, length.out=200)
plot(SS, C[1] + C[["S"]] * SS,
     xlab="Salinity", ylab="Sound Speed [m/s]", type="l", xaxs="i")
grid()
TT <- seq(T0, Tmax, length.out=200)
plot(TT, C[["T"]] * (TT-T0) + C[["T2"]] * (TT-T0)^2 + C[["T3"]] * (TT-T0)^3,
     xlab="Temperature [degC]", ylab="Add to Sound Speed [m/s]", type="l", xaxs="i")
grid()
pp <- seq(p0, pmax, length.out=200)
plot(pp, C[["p"]] * pp + C[["p2"]] * pp^2,
     xlab="Pressure [dbar]", ylab="Add to Sound Speed [m/s]", type="l", xaxs="i")
grid()
```
