# Model selection


```{r echo=FALSE}
load('01_model_selection.rda')
```
See `01_model_selection.R` for the detailed procedure.  In a nutshell, models
`m1`, `m2`, etc explore different combinations of variables. These all take the
form of a polynomial in $S$, $T$ and $p$, where $T$ is in-situ temperature
minus $T_0=`r T0`^\circ$C. (The reason for defining $T$ this way is so the
slide rule scale for temperature can start at $T_0$; an offset like this is not
needed for pressure because $0$dbar is a natural range limit.

Taking first $S$, then $T$ and then $p$, model complexity was increased by
adding polynomial terms, and `summary()` was used to find the highest useful
term, by checking for a probability value (`Pr(>|t|)` in the output) that was
not scored with three asterisks, (i.e. that exceedd the standard R threshold of
2e-16).

The best model was `m4`, and that was saved in `01_model_selection.rda` as
`model`. The coefficients of the model are as follows
```{r}
coef(model)
```
