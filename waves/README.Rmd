A test case is given as ``Example II-2-9'' in Chapter 2 of the Coastal
Engineering Manual (2002): with wind speed 30m/s and fetch 50km, significant
wave height is 4.1m, while the period at the spectral peak is 6.7s.


```{r}

g <- gravity(45)                       # m/s^2 (CEM uss 9.82, appropriate at 60N)
t <- 77.23 * x^0.67 / u10^0.34 / g^0.33 # s
cat('Wind must blow steadily for >', round(t/3600, 2), 'h for result to hold.\n')

# Period at spectral peak (note that the CEM seems to have typesetting errors
# here, using upper-case Xhat, whereas the preceding text has lower-case xhat,
# and putting a hat on lambda2 in one equation but not in he next.
