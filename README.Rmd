A function of the form $y=f_1(x_1)+f_2(x_2)$ or $y=f_1(x_1) f_2(x_2)$ can be
handled with a 2-layer slide rule, while adding another layer permits
$y=f1(x_1)+f2(x_2)+f3(x_3)$, etc.

**Done**

* sigma_theta from S and T. See [sigthe]

**Possible plans**

* sound speed; see [sound_speed]
* distance from delta-lon and delta-lat
* buoy knockdown from radius and water speed
* something to do with instrument time-constants
* something to do with waves. NB: the dispersion relationship is hard because
  it is not in the form $z=f_1(x_1)+f_2(x_2)$.
* something to do with gliders, perhaps buoyancy adjustment or adjusting
  waypoints for currents.
