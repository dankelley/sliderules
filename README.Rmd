A function of the form $y=f_1(x_1)+f_2(x_2)$ or $y=f_1(x_1) f_2(x_2)$ can be
handled with a 2-layer slide rule, while adding another layer permits
$y=f_1(x_1)+f_2(x_2)+f_3(x_3)$, etc.

**Done**

* $\sigma_\theta$ from $S$, $T$ and $p$: see [sigthe](sigthe)

**Possible plans**

* sound speed from $S$, $T$ and $p$: see [sound_speed](sound_speed)
* distance from delta-lon and delta-lat
* buoy knockdown from radius and water speed
* something to do with instrument time-constants
* something to do with waves. NB: the dispersion relationship is hard because
  it is not in the form $z=f_1(x_1)+f_2(x_2)$.
* something to do with gliders, perhaps buoyancy adjustment or adjusting
  waypoints for currents.
