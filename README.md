Oceanographic sliderules

**Done**

* sigma_theta from S and T

**Ideas**

All that is required is to express some z=z(x,y) in the form f1(z)=f2(x)+f3(y);
note that we can change addition to multiplication by using logs.

* distance from delta-lon and delta-lat
* buoy knockdown from radius and water speed
* something to do with instrument time-constants
* something to do with waves. NB: the dispersion relationship is hard because it is not in the form f1(z)=f2(x)+f3(y)
* something to do with gliders (buoyancy adjustment? adjusting waypoints for currents?)
