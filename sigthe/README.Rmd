# Concept

In a linear approximation to the seawater equation of state, assuming constant
pressure $p$, potential density anomaly $\sigma_\theta$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{e1}
\sigma_\theta(S,T) \approx \sigma_\theta(S_0,T_0)\left[1 + \beta(S-S_0)-\alpha(T-T_0)\right]
\end {equation}
where $\alpha=-\sigma_\theta^{-1}\partial\sigma_\theta/\partial T$ and
$\beta=\sigma_\theta^{-1}\partial\sigma_\theta/\partial S$ are constants set up
to approximate the actual equation of state at the desired target pressure, and
over a desired range of $S$ and $T$.

Since density in \eqref{e1} is given by the sum of a linear function of $S$
plus a linear function of $T$, a linear-scale slide-rule could be set up to do
this calculation.  Extending this to a nonlinear equation of state would involve
writing
\begin{equation}
\label{e2}
\sigma_\theta = \sigma_{\theta_0} + F(S-S_0) + G(T-T_0)
\end {equation}
where $F$ and $G$ are devised to approximate the full equation of state over a
reasonable application range.

# Apparatus

![Sketch of slide rule.](sigmat_idea.png)

Figure 1 illustrates the idea for a linear slide rule^[A circular slide rule
could also be set up.].  There are two sliding scales. The lower one has
$\sigma_t$ on the bottom side and $S$ on the top side.  The upper one has $T$
on the lower side.


# Usage

Given $S$ and $T$, density $\rho$ is calculated as follows.

1. Slide the upper scale until the arrow at the left of the $T$ scale lines up
   with the observed $S$.

2. Slide the transparent overlay until its vertical line is on the $T$ of
   interest.

3. Determine $\rho$ by tracing this vertical line down to the bottom scale.

The device can also be used in other ways, e.g. infer $T$, given $S$ and
$\rho$.

# Working notes

```

## First-order linear model

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("01.rda")
C <- coef(m)
res <- residuals(m)
```

Linear least-squares regression analysis (see `01.R`) on an `r n` by `r n`
grid covering $`r S0`<S<`r Smax`$ and $`r T0`<T<`r Tmax`$ yields
\begin{equation}
\label{e3}
\sigma_\theta = `r C['(Intercept)']` +`r C['SS']`(S-S_0) - `r -C['TT']`(T-T_0)
\end{equation}
with $S_0=`r S0`$, $T_0=`r T0`^\circ$C, at pressure $p=0$dbar.  The RMS
misfit of this model is `r round(RMS(res),3)` kg/m$^3$, and the maximum
absolute misfit is $`r max(abs(res))`$kg/m$^3$.

## Second-order model

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("02.rda")
C <- coef(m)
res <- residuals(m)
```

Second-order polynomial least-squares regression analysis (see `02.R`) on an `r n` by `r n`
grid covering $`r S0`<S<`r Smax`$ and $`r T0`<T<`r Tmax`$ yields
\begin{equation}
\label{e4}
\sigma_\theta = `r C['(Intercept)']`+`r C['SS']`(S-S_0)+`r C['SS2']`(S-S_0)^2-`r -C['TT']`(T-T_0)-`r -C['TT2']`(T-T_0)^2
\end{equation}
with $S_0=`r S0`$, $T_0=`r T0`^\circ$C, at pressure $p=0$dbar.  The RMS
misfit of this model is `r round(RMS(res),3)` kg/m$^3$, and the maximum
absolute misfit is $`r max(abs(res))`$kg/m$^3$.

## Second-order model with cross term

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("03.rda")
C <- coef(m)
res <- residuals(m)
```


Second-order polynomial least-squares regression analysis (see `03.R`) on an `r n` by `r n`
grid covering $`r S0`<S<`r Smax`$ and $`r T0`<T<`r Tmax`$ yields
\begin{equation}
\label{e5}
\begin{split}
\sigma_\theta =& `r C['(Intercept)']` +`r C['SS']`(S-S_0) + `r C['SS2']`(S-S_0)^2-`r -C['TT']`(T-T_0)-`r -C['TT2']`(T-T_0)^2\\
&-`r -C['SSTT']`(S-S_*)(T-T_*)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $S_0=`r S0`$, $T_0=`r T0`^\circ$C, $S_*=`r Smid`$, $T_*=`r Tmid`^\circ$C, at
pressure $p=0$dbar.  The RMS misfit is `r round(RMS(res),3)` kg/m$^3$,
and the maximum absolute misfit is $`r max(abs(res))`$kg/m$^3$.

## Second-order model with cross-term and pressure-term

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("04.rda")
C <- coef(m)
res <- residuals(m)
```

Second-order polynomial regression analysis, including pressure (see `04.R`) on
an `r n`x`r n`x`r n` grid covering the ranges $`r S0`<S<`r Smax`$, $`r T0`<T<`r Tmax`$
and $`r p0`<p<`r pmax`$ yields
\begin{equation}
\label{e6}
\begin{split}
\sigma_\theta =& `r C['(Intercept)']` +`r C['SS']`(S-S_0) + `r C['SS2']`(S-S_0)^2\\
&-`r -C['TT']`(T-T_0)-`r -C['TT2']`(T-T_0)^2 -`r -C['SSTT']`(S-S_*)(T-T_*)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $S_0=`r S0`$, $T_0=`r T0`^\circ$C, $S_*=`r Smid`$, $T_*=`r Tmid`^\circ$C.
The RMS misfit is `r round(RMS(res),3)` kg/m$^3$, and the maximum absolute
misfit is $`r max(abs(res))`$kg/m$^3$. (I also tried with a linear pressure
term but the coefficient was `r 2.068e-5`, which is only `r 500*2.068e-5` at
500dbar, so I did not judge this correction important enough (for coastal work)
to justify adding a second correction graph.

# Device consruction

Run `sigma_theta_circular_1.R` non-interactively, which creates files named
`sigma_theta_circular_1_lower.pdf` and `sigma_theta_circular_1_upper.pdf`.
Print the files, and laminate in clear plastic to make reasonably rigid sheets.
Trim each sheet along the dotted gray line, thus forming semi-rigid disks.
Then create a tansparent radial pointer that can reach from the temperature
axis to the central point. Draw a straight line olong the centre of the
pointer, with permanent ink. Puncture the two laminated disks at the central
point (marked with a small circle) and also puncture the pointer along its
central line, at a spot that lets the pointer reach to the temperature scale.

The result is a slide rule for calculating $\sigma_\theta$. To test it, follow
the directions printed on the top layer, and see if you get the indicated test
value.
